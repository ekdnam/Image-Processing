# Image-Processing

## Applying filters

Filters are applied to images in order to reduce noise as well as the blur the image. Blurring the image helps in edge detection.

- Gaussian Filter

The Gaussian smoothing operator is a 2-D convolution operator that is used to blur images and remove detail and noise. In this sense it is similar to the mean filter, but it uses a different kernel that represents the shape of a Gaussian (bell-shaped) hump.

- Mean Filter

The Mean smoothing operator is a 2-D convolution operator that reduces noise by calculating the mean of the pixels in neighbourhood.

- Median Filter

The Median smoothing operator is a 2-D convolution operator that reduces noise by calculating the median of the pixels in neighbourhood.
